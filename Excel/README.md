## Excel

To recreate the graphs in Excel, we can first create PivotCharts using a range of data from the `DW_COUNTY` dataset, then drag and drop the appropriate fields into the Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters sections as necessary.

To recreate the ATTOM Graphs, it was important to first place the `County_State` field into the Filters section and isolate only the 10 counties displays in the article. Then, drag that filtered field into Rows to ensure that the only counties that are included in the PivotTable and PivotChart are the ones in the ATTOM graph.

The PivotTables and PivotCharts can be seen in the similarity titled folder!
