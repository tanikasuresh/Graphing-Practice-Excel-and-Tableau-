### During the Fall 2023 semester, I took Management Information Systems where we learned how to use Excel, Tableau, and SQL.
#### For our final project, the professor shared an article from attomdata.com titled "Top 10 U.S. Housing Markets Considered Affordable in Q3 2023". The article contains two lists/graphs of the Top 10 and Bottom 10 counties based on the percent of annual income required to buy a house in all U.S. counties.
