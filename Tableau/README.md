## Tableau

#### There are seven Tableau worksheets 
#### The first worksheet depicts a heat map of the average `Percentage_Of_Annual_Income_Required_To_Buy` in all counties across the continental US for Q3 of 2023.                                         

#### The second and third worksheets depicts a heat map of the average `Percentage_Of_Annual_Income_Required_To_Buy` in all counties in only Alaska and Hawaii for Q3 of 2023.

#### The fourth worksheet depicts the Top 10 counties based on the average `Percentage_Of_Annual_Income_Required_To_Buy`. It is important to note that the Top 10 counties include the counties with lowest percentages, not the highest.

#### The fifth worksheets depict the Bottom 10 counties, similar to the previous. However, the Bottom 10 indicates the percentages are the highest.

#### For these two worksheets, the graph depicts a line chart for the average percentage on one axis and bar charts for the average Home Value and average `Required_Minimum_Income_Required_To_Buy` on a second axis.

#### The next two worksheets recreate the graphs from the ATTOM article. A key step is to isolate the specific county names in the ATTOM graph using a filter. Then, similar to the previous graphs, the counties are sorted based on the average percentages.

#### Note: The last worksheet does not contain Maui County as shown in the ATTOM article graphs because the dataset does not contain records for Maui County, HI
